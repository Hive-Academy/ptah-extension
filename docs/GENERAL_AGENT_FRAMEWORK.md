## 🚨 UNIVERSAL CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### 🔴 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS (VIOLATIONS = IMMEDIATE FAILURE)

1. **MANDATORY AGENT WORKFLOW**: Every development request MUST use `/orchestrate` command - NO direct implementation unless user explicitly confirms "quick fix only"
2. **TYPE/SCHEMA REUSE PROTOCOL**: Search existing shared/common libraries FIRST, document search in progress.md, extend existing never duplicate
3. **NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: Never target backward compatibility unless explicitly requested by user
4. **NO CROSS-LIBRARY POLLUTION**: Libraries/modules must not re-export types/services from other libraries

### 🎯 QUALITY ENFORCEMENT STANDARDS

- **Type/Schema Safety**: Zero loose types (any, object, \*, etc.) - strict typing always
- **Import Standards**: Use project-detected alias paths consistently
- **Code Size Limits**: Services <200 lines, modules <500 lines, functions <30 lines
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% across line/branch/function coverage
- **Progress Tracking**: Update progress.md every 30 minutes during active development
- **Documentation**: Document architectural decisions and patterns used In their Respective files **DON'T GENERATE MORE FILES THAN NECESSARY ASK USERS BEFORE GENERATING ANY NEW DOCUMENT.**

## ⚡ AGENT WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION

### Sequential Execution Framework

**MANDATORY**: All agent workflows follow this pattern:

1. **User Request** → **Claude Code Main Thread** → **Registry Check**
2. **Route Decision** → **Agent Selection** → **Single Agent Execution**
3. **Agent Completion** → **Quality Gate Validation** → **Return to Main Thread**
4. **Next Agent Selection** OR **Task Completion**

### Core Agent Roles (Technology Agnostic)

| Agent Role             | Symbol | Primary Responsibility                    | When to Invoke                        |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **project-manager**    | 🪃     | Requirements analysis, strategic planning | Complex tasks, new features           |
| **researcher-expert**  | 🔎     | Technical research, best practices        | Knowledge gaps, technology evaluation |
| **software-architect** | 🏗️     | System design, architecture planning      | After requirements clear              |
| **backend-developer**  | 💻     | Server-side implementation                | API, services, data layer work        |
| **frontend-developer** | 🎨     | Client-side implementation                | UI, components, user interaction      |
| **senior-tester**      | 🧪     | Quality assurance, testing strategy       | After implementation                  |
| **code-reviewer**      | 🔍     | Final quality validation                  | Before task completion                |

### Delegation Protocol

**Standard Format for Agent Handoffs:**

```markdown
## DELEGATION REQUEST

**Next Agent**: [agent-name]
**Task Focus**: [specific deliverable]
**Context**: [key information to pass]
**Success Criteria**: [what constitutes success]
**Quality Requirements**: [specific standards]
**Time Budget**: [expected duration]
```

## 🎨 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FRAMEWORK

### Universal Architecture Principles

**SOLID Compliance (Language Agnostic):**

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible through interfaces/protocols/traits
- **Liskov Substitution**: All implementations honor their contracts
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused contracts for specific use cases
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

**Design Pattern Guidelines:**

- **Module Pattern**: Consistent initialization and configuration
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic component creation
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple implementations with selection logic
- **Observer/Event Pattern**: Decoupled communication between components
- **Decorator/Wrapper Pattern**: Cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation, etc.)

### Code Quality Standards

**Type/Schema Safety:**

- Comprehensive type definitions for all data structures
- Runtime validation where static typing unavailable
- Proper error handling and boundary conditions
- No escape hatches unless absolutely necessary with documentation

**Testing Strategy:**

- **Unit Tests**: Mock external dependencies, test individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions with real services
- **E2E Tests**: Full workflow testing from user perspective
- **Performance Tests**: Validate response times and resource usage

### Error Handling Framework

**Universal Error Principles:**

- Comprehensive error boundaries at module/service levels
- Contextual error information (what failed, why, how to recover)
- Graceful degradation where possible
- Proper logging and monitoring for debugging
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance

## 📁 TASK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### Universal Task Structure

**Task ID Format**: `TASK_[DOMAIN]_[NUMBER]`

- **Domains**: CMD (command/core), INT (integration), FE (frontend), BE (backend), QA (quality), DOC (documentation)
- **Numbering**: Sequential (001, 002, 003...)

**Standard Folder Structure:**

```
task-tracking/
  TASK_[ID]/
    ├── task-description.md     # Business requirements, acceptance criteria
    ├── research-report.md      # Technical research (if needed)
    ├── implementation-plan.md  # Architecture and design
    ├── progress.md            # Real-time progress updates
    ├── test-report.md         # Testing results and coverage
    ├── code-review.md         # Quality validation
    └── completion-report.md   # Final metrics and lessons
```

### Quality Gate Framework

**Mandatory Validation at Each Phase:**

1. **Requirements Phase** (Project Manager)
   - [ ] SMART criteria compliance (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
   - [ ] BDD format acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
   - [ ] Comprehensive risk assessment
   - [ ] Stakeholder impact analysis

2. **Research Phase** (Researcher Expert - if needed)
   - [ ] Multiple authoritative sources (minimum 3-5)
   - [ ] Comparative analysis of approaches
   - [ ] Performance and security implications
   - [ ] Production case studies or examples

3. **Architecture Phase** (Software Architect)
   - [ ] SOLID principles compliance
   - [ ] Design pattern justification
   - [ ] Type/schema reuse documented
   - [ ] Integration strategy defined
   - [ ] Performance and scalability considerations

4. **Implementation Phase** (Developers)
   - [ ] Code compiles/builds successfully
   - [ ] Zero loose types or escape hatches
   - [ ] Comprehensive error handling
   - [ ] Unit tests written and passing
   - [ ] Performance within acceptable limits

5. **Testing Phase** (Senior Tester)
   - [ ] Coverage above minimum threshold
   - [ ] All acceptance criteria tested
   - [ ] Edge cases and error conditions covered
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks validated
   - [ ] Security testing completed

6. **Review Phase** (Code Reviewer)
   - [ ] All previous gates passed
   - [ ] Code follows project conventions
   - [ ] No critical security issues
   - [ ] Documentation adequate
   - [ ] Ready for production deployment
