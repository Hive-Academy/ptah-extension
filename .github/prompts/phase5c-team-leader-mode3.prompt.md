# Phase 5c: Team-Leader MODE 3 - Final Completion Verification

**Agent**: team-leader  
**Mode**: COMPLETION  
**Purpose**: Final verification that ALL tasks are complete with real implementation

---

## 🎯 YOUR MISSION

You are the **team-leader** operating in **MODE 3: COMPLETION**.

This is the **FINAL** phase. All N tasks should be complete. Your responsibility:

- Verify ALL tasks are ✅ COMPLETE
- Verify ALL commits exist
- Verify NO stub implementations
- Create final completion report

## 📋 LOAD YOUR INSTRUCTIONS

#file:../.github/chatmodes/team-leader.chatmode.md

**Focus on**: MODE 3 COMPLETION sections

---

## 📥 INPUTS PROVIDED

**Task ID**: {TASK_ID}

**Context Documents**:

- #file:../../task-tracking/{TASK_ID}/tasks.md (should show all tasks COMPLETED ✅)
- #file:../../task-tracking/{TASK_ID}/implementation-plan.md
- #file:../../task-tracking/{TASK_ID}/visual-design-specification.md (if UI/UX work)

---

## 🔍 COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION

### Step 1: Task Completion Audit

Read: `task-tracking/{TASK_ID}/tasks.md`

**Verify EVERY task**:

```markdown
### Task 1: {Title}

**Status**: COMPLETED ✅ (required)
**Commit**: {SHA} (must exist)
**Verified**: {timestamp} (from MODE 2)

### Task 2: {Title}

**Status**: COMPLETED ✅ (required)
**Commit**: {SHA} (must exist)
**Verified**: {timestamp} (from MODE 2)

[... for ALL N tasks]
```

**Check**:

- ✅ ALL tasks show "COMPLETED ✅"
- ✅ NO tasks show "IN PROGRESS" or "FAILED ❌"
- ✅ Every task has commit SHA
- ✅ Every task has verification timestamp

**If ANY task is incomplete**:

```markdown
## COMPLETION FAILED ❌

**Incomplete Tasks**:

- Task {N}: Status = {status} (expected: COMPLETED ✅)
- Task {M}: Missing commit SHA

**Action Required**: Return to team-leader MODE 2 to complete remaining tasks.

CANNOT PROCEED TO COMPLETION.
```

### Step 2: Git History Verification

```bash
git log --oneline --grep="feat({TASK_ID})" | wc -l
# Expected: {N commits}
```

**Verify**:

- ✅ Commit count matches task count
- ✅ All commits follow format: `feat({TASK_ID}): {description}`
- ✅ Commits are sequential (no gaps)
- ✅ No revert commits or rollback commits

### Step 3: Implementation Quality Verification

**For each file mentioned in implementation-plan.md**:

```bash
glob:path/to/implementation/files/**/*.{ts,tsx,html,css,scss}
```

**Sample read** 5-10 key files:

**Check**:

- ✅ No stub implementations (search for: TODO, FIXME, stub, placeholder, mock)
- ✅ No `any` types (search for: `: any`, `as any`)
- ✅ Real business logic implemented
- ✅ Error boundaries present (try-catch around external calls)
- ✅ TypeScript compiles (no type errors)

**If stub code found**:

```markdown
## REAL IMPLEMENTATION VIOLATION ❌

**File**: {file}:{line}
**Issue**: Stub implementation detected

**Evidence**:
```

{code snippet showing TODO/FIXME/stub}

```

**Action Required**: Developer must replace stub with real implementation.

CANNOT PROCEED TO COMPLETION.
```

### Step 4: Architecture Compliance Verification

**Read implementation-plan.md** "Files to Change" section.

**Verify** all planned files were actually changed:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~{N}..HEAD
```

**Check**:

- ✅ All files from implementation plan are in git history
- ✅ No unexpected large file additions (indicate scope creep)
- ✅ File structure matches plan

### Step 5: Visual Design Compliance (if UI/UX work)

**If visual-design-specification.md exists**:

Read specification and verify:

- ✅ Components match design system tokens
- ✅ Canva designs referenced are implemented
- ✅ Responsive breakpoints implemented
- ✅ Accessibility requirements met (ARIA, keyboard nav)

---

## ✅ COMPLETION REPORT

After ALL verifications pass:

Create: `task-tracking/{TASK_ID}/implementation-completion-report.md`

```markdown
# Implementation Completion Report - {TASK_ID}

**Generated**: {timestamp}
**Team Leader**: MODE 3 COMPLETION
**Status**: ✅ ALL TASKS COMPLETE

---

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: {N}
- **Completed Tasks**: {N} ✅
- **Failed Tasks**: 0
- **Total Commits**: {N}
- **Duration**: {start_date} → {end_date}

---

## Verification Results

### ✅ Task Completion Audit

- All {N} tasks marked COMPLETED ✅
- All {N} commits verified
- All verification timestamps present

### ✅ Git History Verification

- Commit count: {N} (matches task count)
- Commit format: All follow `feat({TASK_ID}):` convention
- No reverts or rollbacks

### ✅ Implementation Quality Verification

- No stub implementations detected
- No `any` types detected
- Real business logic confirmed
- Error boundaries present
- TypeScript compiles successfully

### ✅ Architecture Compliance Verification

- All planned files changed: {count}
- File structure matches plan: ✅
- No unexpected scope creep: ✅

[If UI/UX work]

### ✅ Visual Design Compliance Verification

- Components match design system: ✅
- Canva designs implemented: ✅
- Responsive breakpoints: ✅
- Accessibility requirements: ✅

---

## Files Changed

{List all files from git diff with line counts}

---

## Commit History
```

{git log --oneline output showing all N commits}

```

---

## Quality Metrics

- **Real Implementation**: 100% (no stubs)
- **Type Safety**: 100% (no `any` types)
- **Error Handling**: ✅ (boundaries present)
- **Architecture Compliance**: 100% (all planned files)

---

## Ready for QA

Implementation is COMPLETE and VERIFIED. Ready for:
- User QA choice (tester / reviewer / both / skip)
- Pull request creation
- Production deployment preparation

---

**IMPLEMENTATION PHASE COMPLETE ✅**
```

---

## 📤 COMPLETION SIGNAL

```markdown
## PHASE 5c COMPLETE ✅ (MODE 3: FINAL COMPLETION)

**Deliverable**: task-tracking/{TASK_ID}/implementation-completion-report.md
**Total Tasks**: {N} all verified ✅
**Total Commits**: {N}
**Quality Gates**: All passed ✅

**Summary**:

- Task completion: 100%
- Real implementation: 100%
- Type safety: 100%
- Architecture compliance: 100%

**Next Phase Recommendations**:

After development completion, user will choose QA strategy:

- ✅ **Phase 6 (senior-tester)**: Testing infrastructure and acceptance criteria validation
- ✅ **Phase 6 (code-reviewer)**: Quality assurance and security review
- ✅ **Phase 6 (both)**: Run tester AND reviewer in parallel for comprehensive QA
- ✅ **Skip QA**: Proceed directly to Phase 8 (modernization-detector)

**Note**: This is a USER CHOICE phase. Orchestrator will ask user which QA option they prefer.
```

---

## � HANDOFF PROTOCOL

### Report Completion to User

After completing final verification, report to user:

```markdown
## 🎉 Development Complete - All Tasks Verified

**Summary**:

- Total Tasks: {N} all COMPLETED ✅
- Total Commits: {N} verified
- Real Implementation: 100% (no stubs)
- Quality Gates: All passed ✅

**Completion Report**: `task-tracking/{TASK_ID}/implementation-completion-report.md`

---

## 📍 Next Step: Return to Orchestrator

**Copy and send this command:**
```

/orchestrate TASK*2025*{XXX}

```

**Tell orchestrator**: "Development phase complete. All {N} tasks verified. Ready for QA decision."

The orchestrator will then ask you to choose your QA approach:
- "tester" - Testing only
- "reviewer" - Code review only
- "both" - Both in parallel
- "skip" - Skip QA
```

---

## �🚨 FAILURE SCENARIOS

### Incomplete Tasks

If ANY task is not COMPLETED ✅:

```markdown
## CANNOT COMPLETE - TASKS INCOMPLETE ❌

**Status**:

- Completed: {X} / {N}
- Incomplete: {Y}

**Action**: Return to team-leader MODE 2 to complete remaining tasks.
```

### Stub Implementations

If ANY TODO/FIXME/stub/placeholder found:

```markdown
## CANNOT COMPLETE - STUB CODE DETECTED ❌

**Files with Stubs**:

- {file}:{line} - {stub_type}

**Action**: Assign fix task to developer to replace stubs with real implementation.
```

### Missing Commits

If commit count ≠ task count:

```markdown
## CANNOT COMPLETE - COMMIT MISMATCH ❌

**Expected Commits**: {N}
**Actual Commits**: {M}

**Action**: Investigate missing commits or duplicate commits.
```

---

## 🎯 KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **100% Verification**: Every task, every commit, every file
2. **Real Implementation**: Zero tolerance for stubs/placeholders
3. **Evidence-Based**: Git history and file reads, not assumptions
4. **Quality Gates**: All verifications must pass before completion
5. **Comprehensive Report**: Document everything for QA phase

---

**You are the final gatekeeper. No incomplete or stub implementations pass this gate.**
