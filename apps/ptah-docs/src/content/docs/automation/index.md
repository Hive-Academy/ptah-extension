# Automation

Ptah doesn't have to be in front of you to be useful. Two automation surfaces let it work while you don't:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Cron Scheduler" icon="seti:clock">
    Schedule recurring AI tasks with cron expressions. Persists across restarts; catches up after sleep. [Learn more →](/automation/cron/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Messaging Gateway" icon="comment-alt">
    Drive Ptah from Telegram, Discord, or Slack. Voice messages welcome. [Learn more →](/automation/messaging/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Both share storage at `~/.ptah/ptah.db` and configuration in `~/.ptah/settings.json`. Both are off-by-default until you opt in.
