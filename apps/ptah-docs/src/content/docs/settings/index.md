Ptah has a two-layer settings model that keeps personal preferences portable while letting each project override the bits that matter for that project.

## The two layers

| Layer         | Location                                        | Purpose                                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Global**    | `~/.ptah/settings.json`                         | User-wide preferences — provider API keys, default model, theme, MCP port |
| **Workspace** | `<workspace>/.claude/` and `<workspace>/.ptah/` | Per-project agents, plugins, templates, and overrides                     |

Workspace settings win when both layers define the same key. This matches how VS Code, Git, and most modern editors resolve configuration.

## Where to edit

- Open **Settings** from the left-hand rail (or press `Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`).
- Most options can be edited through the UI.
- Power users can edit `~/.ptah/settings.json` directly — changes are picked up on the next launch.

## What's in this section

- **Global settings** — the full schema of `~/.ptah/settings.json`, including provider API keys
- **Workspace settings** — how `.claude/` and `.ptah/` shape per-project behavior
- **Theme** — light/dark and accent color
- **API keys** — how to obtain credentials for each provider
- **Autopilot** — autonomous execution toggles
- **Import & export** — backup and restore your configuration
- **Why not package.json?** — rationale for storing provider settings outside `package.json`

Need to reset to defaults? Delete `~/.ptah/settings.json` and relaunch Ptah — a fresh file is generated.
