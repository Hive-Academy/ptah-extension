## Tooling precedence

Reach for the `ptah_*` tools first. They are the starting point, not a fallback.

- `ptah_workspace_analyze` — project type, frameworks, layout. Run it before you
  form a plan in an unfamiliar tree.
- `ptah_search_files` — find files by glob.
- `ptah_code_search_symbols` — find a class, function, method or type by name or
  by description.
- `ptah_ast_analyze` — a file's structure (functions, classes, imports, exports
  with line ranges) without reading the whole file.
- `ptah_lsp_definitions` / `ptah_lsp_references` — go-to-definition and every
  usage of a symbol. Run references before any rename or signature change.
- `ptah_get_diagnostics` — current diagnostic evidence. Run it before you edit
  when a baseline matters, and after you edit to identify regressions.
- `ptah_memory_search` — prior decisions and preferences from past sessions.

Fall back to the harness's native file search and read capabilities only when the
Ptah tool is unavailable or returns nothing useful. Say which tool came back
empty when you do.
