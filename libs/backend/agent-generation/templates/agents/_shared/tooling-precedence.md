## Working rules

- `ptah_*` tools first when listed; `ptah_lsp_references` before renames, `ptah_get_diagnostics` after edits; native read/search only as fallback, naming the empty tool. Unlisted: do not probe.

| Native step | Ptah tool |
| --- | --- |
| Manual workspace exploration | ptah_workspace_analyze |
| Bash find / Glob | ptah_search_files |
| Grep/Glob for function, class, method | ptah_code_search_symbols |
| Read full file for structure | ptah_ast_analyze |
| Grep for symbol usages | ptah_lsp_references |
| Run build to check errors | ptah_get_diagnostics |
| Recall past decisions / preferences | ptah_memory_search |
| Guess which files matter | ptah_relevance_rank_files |

write, build, test and git stay native
