## Working rules

- `ptah_*` tools first; `ptah_get_diagnostics` after edits. A deferred ptah tool counts as listed: if your client defers tool schemas, load it with its tool-search tool (Claude Code: `ToolSearch` `select:<name>`), otherwise call it directly. A tool that is not listed at all: use the native one, do not probe.
- Native read/search only for free-text search (string literals, config keys, error messages), or after a ptah error or zero hits; then Grep once and name the empty tool.

| Native step | Ptah tool |
| --- | --- |
| Manual workspace exploration | ptah_workspace_analyze |
| Bash find / Glob | ptah_search_files |
| Grep/Glob for function, class, method | ptah_code_search_symbols |
| Read full file for structure | ptah_ast_analyze |
| Grep for symbol usages | ptah_code_search_symbols for file/line/col, then ptah_lsp_references |
| Run build to check errors | ptah_get_diagnostics |
| Recall past decisions / preferences | ptah_memory_search |
| Guess which files matter | ptah_relevance_rank_files |

write, build, test and git stay native
